My research examines fundamental questions of violent extremism, cyberterrorism, technology and society, social networks, fairness, accountability, transparency and ethics as they relate to AI and machine learning. My research is motivated by the large-scale online social data, advances in statistics, computational social science and machine learning techniques and tools.

My dissertation focuses on online criminal behaviors (cyberterrorism), specifically how terrorists and violent extremists use the Internet and technology, and how to counter online extremism using machine learning, natural language processing and social network analysis techniques. 

I am also interested in analyzing fairness, accountability, transparency and ethics as they relate to AI and machine learning, specifically how algorithms are applied within the criminal justice system for sentencing and surveillance. During the Data Science for Social Good fellowship at the eScience Institute, University of Washington, Seattle, I was part of a team that developed an Algorithmic Equity Toolkit with ACLU-WA and other community organizations. The Toolkit can be accessed and downloaded from here: <a onclick="window.open('https://www.aclu-wa.org/AEKit')"></a>
