My research examines fundamental questions of violent extremism, cyberterrorism, technology and society, social networks, fairness, accountability, transparency and ethics as they relate to AI and machine learning. My research is motivated by the large-scale online social data, advances in statistics, computational social science and machine learning techniques and tools.

# Dissertation:

My dissertation focuses on online criminal behaviors (cyberterrorism), specifically how terrorists and violent extremists use the Internet and technology, and how to counter online extremism using machine learning, natural language processing and social network analysis techniques.
